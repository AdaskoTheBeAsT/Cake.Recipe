Description: Instructions on how to contribute to Cake.Recipe
---

The Cake.Recipe repository is using [GitFlow] branching strategy, with default configuration.
As such, active Development is happening on the `develop` branch, unless we are currently in the process of doing a hotfix.

To contribute:

* Fork this repository.
* Create a feature branch from `develop`, for example `git checkout -b feature/GH-xxx develop`
* Implement your changes.
* Push your feature branch to your fork.
* Create a pull request, targeting the `develop` branch.

For getting started see issues marked with `Up-for-grabs` in the repository.
